# Javascript Calculator

This is a calculator built using vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript. I completed this project following a tutorial as I wanted to learn a more advanced project using Javascript to build
on the skills and concept I learnt during the freecodecamp.org Javascript course. Most of the logic is therefore not my own original code. However, in order to test my own understanding
I added additional features to the calculator such as a decimal button, position/negative function button, an answer button as well as differentiating between all clear (AC) and clear (C), 
with clear retaining the stored answer.
